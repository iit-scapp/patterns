## Markup and Design Patterns

This repo contains markup patterns and associated styles for structuring and presenting components
of each of self-compassion app’s Modules.

The goals here are:

1. Establish reusable markup patterns and styles for constructing Modules.
2. Anchor discussions about the app’s content and presentation, including the uniformity of Modules.
3. Prepare the way for a templated markup system for the app’s actual delivery.

The patterns here are representative selection from each of the three modules in the
[Modules doc on Basecamp](https://3.basecamp.com/3058761/buckets/25721548/uploads/4519250916).

## Module Structure

Modules consist of three parts:

1. A psychoeducational component
2. One or more activities
3. A wrap-up component

### Psychoeducational Structures
* Short educational points (single bullets)
* Complex educational points (single bullets with multiple sub-bullets; some with examples)

### Activity Structures
* Instructions, which may be presented as audio (or video)
* Single activities (one per module)
* Multiple activities (presented as a menu of options)

### Wrap-Up Structures
* Invitation to complete more activities
* Invitation to return to the app later (sometimes including previous activity responses)
